TreeviewJs Core files are in the "treeviewJS/src" folder. The next files are required scripts.

1. src/treeview.js
2. src/treeview.config.js

if you want to make the treeview.js does not the errors occurred and work correctly, You must import a treeview.config.js after load treeview.js
And, you want to support the IE11 optionally, you need to import the script files, keyboard.js, and scope-polyfill.js in the "lib_external/src" folder before loading the required script.

The rest of the script files are the script for only configuring the documentation page.
